        <h1 id="header">B'razn's Beginnings</h1>
        <h2>B'rajj's Farm</h2>

        <p>
            B'razn was born on the road, but he spent most of his adolescent life on his father's farm. B'razn always enjoyed helping his family, which was almost necessary, as his family was relatively small for a Seeker tribe; Besides B'rajj Nuhn, B'razn's parents
            include his five mothers, all of whom spent much time cleaning up aftert the clumsy lad. M'aria tended to coddle him, but she was also one of his harshest critics. Due to the nature of B'rajj's homefront, B'razn spent a significant amount
            of time playing with Kobold and Sahagin children, which led him to have some skill in speaking to them in their own language. B'razn is very friendly with the beast tribes, and cannot stand seeing them discriminated against. B'rajj's farm
            consisted of one large garden, a dodo ranch, and a flock of karakul. B'razn's strength came in handy with much of the farm work, even if his clumsiness caused more trouble than was strictly neccisary.
        </p>

        <h2>The <i>Banshee's Cry</i></h2>
        <p>
            While visiting Aleport with his childhood friend, O'rolin, B'razn performed odd jobs to make pocket change, and ended up tiring himself out so much that he fell asleep in a crate, which was loaded onto the pirate ship, the <i>Banshee's Cry</i>.
            Assuming he was a stowaway, the captain, Khezlsyng, had him strung up by his ankles. When he finally awoke, he was less perturbed, and more excited. His father had never agreed with pirates, but B'razn had always wanted to be one. Offering
            to help around on the ship to make up for stowing away, it wasn't long before B'razn had become a fully-fledged member of the crew. <br><br>As the rest of the crew was exclusively women, B'razn wasn't allowed to bunk with everyone else, instead
            retrofitting one of the brig cells into his bedroom. Being a mere 12 summers old, he was placed under the care of a Keeper of the Moon Miqo'te, Pascal. Pascal soon came to see B'razn as a younger brother, a feeling B'razn reciprocated. A few
            years later, he was introduced to Pascal's biological brother, Neaul'a, when they made port. Neaul'a grew very fond of his new big brother very quickly, and looked up to the young mage, even going as far as to aspire to learning magic himself.
            <br><br> At 18 summers old, after finally learning his port from his starboard, B'razn was involved in a fateful fight with a Garlean cargo ship. After deftly dispatching the Garleans, the crew of the <i>Cry</i> stripped the ship bare, and
            set a coarse back to Limsa Lominsa. However, on the voyage back, B'razn stumbled upon a surviving Garlean attempting to murder one of his crewmates, Abylnwyn. In a bid to save her, B'razn knocked the Garlean down with a non-fatal blow, but
            foolishly turned his back to the attacker to check on his terrified teammate. While he was checking on Abylnwyn, the Garlean grabbed B'razn by his tail and tried to cut it off. The cut wasn't clean, but still cut off enough that the tail later
            needed to be amputated, leaving B'razn without the ability to balance. This effectively ended his career as a pirate, and he was sent home.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Road to recovery
        </h2>
        <p>
            After returning home, B'razn spent his time training to recover his lost balance by helping out on the farm, usually assisted by his younger sisters, and occasionally by his new brother-in-law, O'rolin, who had since taken up residence on B'rajj's farm
            as a form of atonement for failing to keep B'razn safe. M'aria, B'razn's birth mother, was instrumental in this, as her cold stare locked young O'rolin in place, frozen in fear, until he agreed to help. In that time, he fell in love with B'razn's
            younger sister, B'saria, and moved to B'rajj's farm. <br><br> After some time, a surprise visit from X'rhun Tia, B'rajj's old comrade and B'razn's Red Mage rolemodel, prompted B'razn to try harder. After attempting to spar, X'rhun
            realized how bad things had gotten, and wracked his brain, thinking of a way to help his pupil. Luckily, this did not take long, and B'razn was soon enrolled in a dancing school run by X'rhun's friend, Kryssgeim. Slow moving at first, B'razn
            soon began to salvage his balance, albeit only partially. Even after Kryssgeim's lessons, B'razn remained clumsy, and frequently breaks furniture on accident. Soon afterwards, another visitor came. <br><br> B'razn was happy to see Pascal,
            but she was accompanied by Abylnwyn, who B'razn had a strained relationship with; Before the attack, Abylnwyn was anything but cordial to the young Miqo'te, and her aggressiveness had won her little in the way of comraderie. Despite this,
            Abylnwyn came to B'rajj's farm, ostensibly to find employment, but truely to help B'razn recover in any way she could, as she felt responsible for the loss of his tail.

        </p>
        <h2>Maelstrom's Madman</h2>
        <p>
            As soon as he thought he was ready, B'razn joined the Maelstrom. He wished he could return to the <i>Cry</i>, but realized that being on a ship would only hamper his ability to stand even more. Abylnwyn joined alongside him, to "Keep him out
            o' trouble." B'razn's strength was already known to Merlwyb, who recruited them both to the Foreign Levy, a troop of adventurers and those foerign to Vylbrand. He was soon given command, and achieved the rank of Captain, despite his short
            time serving, due to his strength and convictions. This was around the time he met Nanavii Navi, and took her in, much to Abylnwyn's chagrin. Not long after, B'razn was given his first big mission: To stop Garlean forces from gaining a foothold
            in Vylbrand, near Aleport. Pascal and Abylnwyn in tow and Nanavii left behind, B'razn lead his men into battle.
            <br><br>The battle was fierce, but B'razn claimed victory, albeit at a cost. In the attack, Pascal, B'razn's adopted sister, died defending her little brother. B'razn witnessed her death, and went out of his way to recover her body afterwards.
            B'razn was heartbroken, and despite his fear and sorrow, delivered the message to Neaul'a and the two held a funeral. B'razn began to withdraw, but he learned his lesson. Unfortunately, this lesson was not the only one the Garleans had to
            teach. Once again attempting to establish a base in Vylbrand, the Garleans returned. B'razn, eager to get revenge for his big sister, lead his men headlong into battle.<br><br> Victory was sure, but pyrrhic. B'razn lost all of his squadron.
            He was just fast enough to listen to Abylnwyn's last words, begging him to promise to keep helping everyone he could, just because he can. Abylnwyn's true feelings for B'razn still eluded him, and she never got to tell him how she felt. In
            a fit of anger and desperation, B'razn flew into a rage and finished his mission, destroying the would-be Castrum. Following the mission, B'razn resigned from the Maelstrom, to become an adventurer. Nanavii, to her credit, cared for B'razn
            through his depression, making sure he ate and didn't forget the money from his Adventurer Guild missions.
